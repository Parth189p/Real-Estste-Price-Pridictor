# Real-Estste-Price-Pridictor
In this Project I worked on a real-world dataset. Using different data science techniques like data cleaning, feature engineering, etc ... I built a Machine learning model that predict the price of the real estate.

In this project i used different libraries of python to perform data analysis and to build a machine learning model.

  The dataset that I used in this project is the UCI dataset of boaston housing.
  
              Real-Estate.ipynb - Jupyter notebook where i have done all the processes
              data.csv - csv file of boaston housing data
              outputfrom different models is shown the differnce between the accurecy of difffernt algorithams that i used to pridict price.and than choose the best one.
              real estate.joblib - it is the ready model file that can deploy in the website with the python flask.
              Model Usage.ipynb - this notebook show only usage of the mopdel.

# Real-Estste-Price-Pridictor
In this Project I worked on a real-world dataset. Using different data science techniques like data cleaning, feature engineering, etc ... I built a Machine learning model that predict the price of the real estate.

In this project i used different libraries of python to perform data analysis and to build a machine learning model.

  The dataset that I used in this project is the UCI dataset of boaston housing.
